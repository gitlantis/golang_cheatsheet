### Godoc
Godoc extracts and generates documentation for Go programs.

Here’s an example using C++-style single-line comments:
```go
// User is a struct model containing  
type User struct {  
   
}
```
You can also use C-style block comments:
```go
/*  
User is a custom data structure  
   
You can include any text here and the Godoc server will format it when you run it.  
*/  
type User struct {  
   
}
```

#### Running a Godoc Server
Once you have commented your code, you can run the **godoc** command in your terminal, from your project’s code directory.
Conventionally, Go developers use port **6060** to host documentation. This is the command for running a Godoc server on that port:
```
godoc -http=:6060 
```
The command above hosts your code documentation on [localhost, or 127.0.0.1](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-127-0-0-1-localhost-loopback-address/). The port doesn’t have to 6060; godoc will run on any unoccupied port. However, it’s always best to follow the Go documentation conventions.
```go
// name of the package  
package user  
   
// fmt is responsible for formatting  
import (  
    "fmt"  
)  
   
// User is a struct of human data  
type User struct {  
    Age int  
    Name string  
}  
   
func main() {  
    // human is an initialization of the User struct  
    human := User {  
        Age: 0,  
        Name: "person",  
    }  
   
    fmt.Println(human.Talk())  
}  
   
// Talk is a method of the User struct  
func (receiver User) Talk() string {  
    return "Every User Gets to Say Something!"  
}
```

### Gofmt
Formatting of source code adds an important feature to the quality and readability of the code. In Golang, we have built-in packages and commands to auto-format code in the source file as per the standards and best practices. We can use the gofmt command in the CLI to autoformat a Golang source file. We can autoformat the go code with gofmt package in Golang. Using the command gofmt command from the terminal or command line, we can format the go source file.
```
go fmt filename.go
```

#### Store Formatted Code in New file
We can store the formatted code in a new file using the > operator. This operator allows us to define a refactoring file and the original source file to be formatted. 
```
gofmt original_file.go > output_file.go
```

#### Generating a Diff from the fmt command
We can even generate the diff for the formatted code in a different file using the -d parameter in the fmt command,
```
gofmt -d original_file.go
```

### Go vet
Go vet command is a handy tool that can help you write better and cleaner code. It helps you find errors in your application and reports suspicious constructs such as abnormal or useless code, as well as detect common mistakes using different packages.

Vet command (or should we say vet commands?) is a collection of different analysis tool commands and sub-analyzers. It is worth mentioning that vet uses heuristics which can’t guarantee that 100% of the reports will be genuine issues. However, it can detect errors that compliers might omit.

#### Using the vet command
You can invoke vet with the go command. The following command will vet the current directory package:
```
go vet
```
If you wish to vet a package in another directory you need to provide a path:
```
go vet my_machine/project/...
```
If you want to vet specific packages you can use:
```
go help packages
```

### Pprof
Package pprof serves via its HTTP server runtime profiling data in the format expected by the pprof visualization tool.
Let's say this is the code you want to profile:  

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
    "time"
)

// Some function that does work
func hardWork(wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
    defer wg.Done()
    fmt.Printf("Start: %v\n", time.Now())

    // Memory
    a := []string{}
    for i := 0; i < 500000; i++ {
        a = append(a, "aaaa")
    }

    // Blocking
    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
    fmt.Printf("End: %v\n", time.Now())
}

func main() {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    wg.Add(1)
    go hardWork(&wg)
    wg.Wait()
}

```

Now let's profile it, to do that we need to:

1.  Install dependencies: `apt-get install graphviz gv` (debian) or `brew install graphviz` (mac)
2.  Install pprof: `go get -u github.com/google/pprof`
3.  Add an import: `import _ "net/http/pprof"`
4.  Add a server for `pprof`:

```go
go func() {
  fmt.Println(http.ListenAndServe("localhost:6060", nil))
}()
```

It should look something like this:  

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
    "sync"
    "time"

    _ "net/http/pprof"
)

// Some function that does work
func hardWork(wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
    defer wg.Done()
    fmt.Printf("Start: %v\n", time.Now())

    // Memory
    a := []string{}
    for i := 0; i < 500000; i++ {
        a = append(a, "aaaa")
    }

    // Blocking
    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
    fmt.Printf("End: %v\n", time.Now())
}

func main() {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup

    // Server for pprof
    go func() {
        fmt.Println(http.ListenAndServe("localhost:6060", nil))
    }()
    wg.Add(1) // pprof - so we won't exit prematurely
    wg.Add(1) // for the hardWork
    go hardWork(&wg)
    wg.Wait()
}
```

When you type: `go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap` while the server is running (in a different terminal) and then type `png` you will get something like the following:  
![[Pasted image 20230503190208.png]]

As you can see, `hardWork` is consuming some memory.  
If you want to check the goroutines you can replace the line to:  
`go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/goroutine`

You can choose between:

-   CPU: `profile?seconds=10`
-   Memory: `heap`
-   Goroutines: `goroutine`
-   Goroutine blocking: `block`
-   Locks: `mutex`
-   Tracing: `trace?seconds=5`

### Linters (GolangCI, golint and etc)
_Linter is a tool that analyzes source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs._
**Using Linter provides many benefit. Some of them are given below:**
1.  Find bugs
2.  Catch bugs early
3.  Speed up code review
4.  Manage code quality

There are more than 50 linters in Go programming language. However, only few are useful. Most common way to use linters in open source project is to use some subset of linters. For example: **go** **vet**, **errcheck**, and **golint** are popular linters and are really cool.

### Dependencies Management. Mod
Dependencies are packages which are required for your projects to run. For example, if your project uses [protobuf](https://github.com/golang/protobuf) package, then protobuf is a dependency on the project. Dependency management is important to get right for any programming language, and with Go, this has been tricky since its inception.

### Problem Statement
Initially no dependency management system existed in Go and ‘go get’ was the only way to download dependencies which pulls the code from the master branch of a repository. This right here is a time ticking bomb.
We ran into this issue once on production, and that was the triggering point where we started researching the possible solutions for managing dependencies.

#### Solution Approaches
We analyzed third party tool like [**dep**](https://github.com/golang/dep) and concepts such as **vendoring** (_it’s an approach where all the dependencies are kept inside vendor folder in the codebase_) to manage the dependencies. We also analyzed Go’s new dependency management system (_Go Module_) introduced in Go1.11.
![[Pasted image 20230503190909.png]]
**Analysing the pros and cons of these solutions, we preferred ‘Go Module’ due to the following reasons:**
-   ‘Go Module’ provides a much cleaner way to manage dependencies as compared to any other solutions.
-   Since it comes with the language, no need to install any third party tool like dep.
-   It is the future of dependency management in Go. Go community is actively working on it, many new features will be added in the future releases.
-   Provides a feature for warming caches in docker builds which helps in reducing deployment time

[Go Module](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules) is a new dependency management system inbuilt in Go that makes dependency version information explicit and easier to manage.

A module is a collection of Go packages stored in a file tree with a go.mod file at its root. The go.mod file defines the module’s module path and its dependency requirements. Each dependency requirement is written as a module path and a specific [semantic version](https://semver.org/).

[Go 1.11](https://golang.org/doc/go1.11) and [1.12](https://golang.org/doc/go1.12) include preliminary support for modules.  
Starting in [Go 1.13](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.13), module mode will be the default for all development.

### Dependencies Management. Dep
`dep` is a dependency management tool for Go. It requires Go 1.9 or newer to compile.
**NOTE:** Dep was an official experiment to implement a package manager for Go. As of 2020, Dep is deprecated and archived in favor of Go modules, which have had official support since Go 1.11. For more details, see [https://golang.org/ref/mod](https://golang.org/ref/mod).

For guides and reference materials about `dep`, see [the documentation](https://golang.github.io/dep).
