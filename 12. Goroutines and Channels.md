A goroutine is **a lightweight execution thread in the Go programming language and a function that executes concurrently with the rest of the program**. Goroutines are incredibly cheap when compared to traditional threads as the overhead of creating a goroutine is very low.

### How Go Executes Code
The key building block for executing a Go program is the goroutine, which is a lightweight thread created by the Go runtime. All Go programs use at least one goroutine because this is how Go executes the code in the main function. When compiled Go code is executed, the runtime creates a goroutine that starts executing the statements in the entry point, which is the main function in the main package. Each statement in the main function is executed in the order in which they are defined. The goroutine keeps executing statements until it reaches the end of the main function, at which point the application terminates. The goroutine executes each statement in the main function synchronously, which means that it waits for the statement to complete before moving on to the next statement. The statements in the main function can call other functions, use for loops, create values, and use all the other features described in this book. The main goroutine will work its way through the code, following its path by executing one statement at a time. For the example application, this means that the map of products is processed sequentially so that each product category is processed in turn, and, within each category, each product is processed.

Adding a Statement in the operations.go
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func CalcStoreTotal(data ProductData) {
	var storeTotal float64
	for category, group := range data {
		storeTotal += group.TotalPrice(category)
	}
	fmt.Println("Total:", ToCurrency(storeTotal))
}
func (group ProductGroup) TotalPrice(category string) (total float64) {
	for _, p := range group {
		fmt.Println(category, "product:", p.Name)
		total += p.Price
	}
	fmt.Println(category, "subtotal:", ToCurrency(total))
	return
}
```

### Creating Additional Goroutines
Go allows the developer to create additional goroutines, which execute code at the same time as the main goroutine. Go makes it easy to create new goroutines
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func CalcStoreTotal(data ProductData) {
	var storeTotal float64
	for category, group := range data {
		go group.TotalPrice(category)
	}
	fmt.Println("Total:", ToCurrency(storeTotal))
}
func (group ProductGroup) TotalPrice(category string) (total float64) {
	for _, p := range group {
		fmt.Println(category, "product:", p.Name)
		total += p.Price
	}
	fmt.Println(category, "subtotal:", ToCurrency(total))
	return
}
```

Getting a result from a function that is being executed asynchronously can be complicated because it requires coordination between the goroutine that produces the result and the goroutine that consumes the result. To address this issue, Go provides channels, which are conduits through which data can be sent and received.
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func CalcStoreTotal(data ProductData) {
	var storeTotal float64
	var channel chan float64 = make(chan float64)
	for category, group := range data {
		go group.TotalPrice(category)
	}
	fmt.Println("Total:", ToCurrency(storeTotal))
}
func (group ProductGroup) TotalPrice(category string) (total float64) {
	for _, p := range group {
		fmt.Println(category, "product:", p.Name)
		total += p.Price
		time.Sleep(time.Millisecond * 100)
	}
	fmt.Println(category, "subtotal:", ToCurrency(total))
	return
}
```

### Sending a Result Using a Channel
Using a Channel to Send a Result in the operations.go
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func CalcStoreTotal(data ProductData) {
	var storeTotal float64
	var channel chan float64 = make(chan float64)
	for category, group := range data {
		go group.TotalPrice(category)
	}
	fmt.Println("Total:", ToCurrency(storeTotal))
}
func (group ProductGroup) TotalPrice(category string, resultChannel chan float64) {
	var total float64
	for _, p := range group {
		fmt.Println(category, "product:", p.Name)
		total += p.Price
		time.Sleep(time.Millisecond * 100)
	}
	fmt.Println(category, "subtotal:", ToCurrency(total))
	resultChannel <- total
}
```

### Receiving a Result Using a Channel
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func CalcStoreTotal(data ProductData) {
	var storeTotal float64
	var channel chan float64 = make(chan float64)
	for category, group := range data {
		go group.TotalPrice(category, channel)
	}
	for i := 0; i < len(data); i++ {
		storeTotal += <-channel
	}
	fmt.Println("Total:", ToCurrency(storeTotal))
}
func (group ProductGroup) TotalPrice(category string, resultChannel chan float64) {
	var total float64
	for _, p := range group {
		fmt.Println(category, "product:", p.Name)
		total += p.Price
		time.Sleep(time.Millisecond * 100)
	}
	fmt.Println(category, "subtotal:", ToCurrency(total))
	resultChannel <- total
}
```

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	//"time"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("main function started")
	CalcStoreTotal(Products)
	//time.Sleep(time.Second * 5)
	fmt.Println("main function complete")
}
```
The overall effect of these changes is that the program starts and begins executing the statements in the main function. This leads to the CalcStoreTotal function being called, which creates a channel and starts several goroutines. The goroutines execute the statements in the TotalPrice method, which sends its result using the channel. The main goroutine continues executing the statements in the CalcStoreTotal function, which receives the results through the channel. Those results are used to create an overall total, which is written out. The remaining statements in the main function are executed, and the program terminates. Compile and execute the project, and you will see the following output:
```go
main function started 
Watersports product: Kayak 
Chess product: Thinking Cap 
Soccer product: Soccer Ball 
Soccer product: Corner Flags 
Watersports product: Lifejacket 
Chess product: Unsteady Chair 
Chess product: Bling-Bling King 
Soccer product: Stadium 
Watersports subtotal: $328.95 
Chess subtotal: $1291.00 
Soccer subtotal: $79554.45 
Total: $81174.40 
main function complete
```

### Working with Channels
By default, sending and receiving through a channel are blocking operations. This means a goroutine that sends a value will not execute any further statements until another goroutine receives the value from the channel. If a second goroutine sends a value, it will be blocked until the channel is cleared, causing a queue of goroutines waiting for values to be received. This happens in the other direction, too, so that goroutines that receive values will block until another goroutine sends one.

### Atomic Operations
If we do an operation like increment or decrement using channels on a single shared variable, the goroutines will not be synchronized and will produce erroneous output. The atomic operations, on the other hand, are implemented at the hardware level. That means when we create a shared atomic variable and use multiple goroutines to update its value it will be updated correctly.
```go
package main
 
import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
    // "sync/atomic"
)
 
func f(v *int, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
    for i := 0; i < 3000; i++ {
        *v++
    }
    wg.Done()
}
 
func main() {
    var v int = 42
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    wg.Add(2)
    go f(&v, &wg)
    go f(&v, &wg)
    wg.Wait()
 
    fmt.Println(v)
}
```
![[Pasted image 20230502091133.png]]
As can be seen each time the program is run it will produce the wrong output. It happens due to the fact the goroutines accessing and changing the value is not synchronized. So, the changed values are arbitrary and will result in the wrong number of operations.
```go
package main
 
import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
    "sync/atomic"
)
 
func f(v *uint32, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
    for i := 0; i < 3000; i++ {
        atomic.AddUint32(v, 1)
    }
    wg.Done()
}
 
func main() {
    var v uint32 = 42
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    wg.Add(2)
    go f(&v, &wg)
    go f(&v, &wg)
    wg.Wait()
 
    fmt.Println(v)
}
```

### Use of atomic operations in Golang

Atomic operations are used when we need to have a shared variable between different goroutines which will be updated by them. If the updating operation is not synchronized then it will create a problem that we saw.

Atomic operations solve that problem by synchronizing access to the shared variable and making the output correct.

### Scheduler
In Go and Golang programming, a scheduler is responsible for distributing jobs in a multiprocessing environment. When the available resources are limited, it is the task of the scheduler to manage the work that needs to be done in the most efficient way. In Go, the scheduler is responsible for scheduling goroutines, which is particularly useful in concurrency. Goroutines are like OS threads, but they are much lighter weight. However, goroutines always take the help of the underlying OS thread model and the scheduler it works on is at a much higher level than the OS scheduler.

### Go’s Runtime Scheduler
The Go runtime scheduler schedules goroutines. A goroutine is a lightweight thread that has the ability to execute on a single OS thread. The OS threads run on single or multiple available processors. The runtime scheduler of Go distributes goroutines over multiple threads. The scheduler determines the state of the goroutine. A life cycle of the goroutine can be in one of three fundamental states : _running_, _runnable_, and _not runnable_ (due to IO blocked or system call):
![[Pasted image 20230502095547.png]]
Go works on a type of scheduler called an **m:n scheduler (M:N scheduler)**, which states that **M** number of goroutines can be distributed over **N** number of OS threads. Comparatively, OS threads have much more overhead than goroutines. Therefore, Go uses a limited number of threads to run a maximum number of goroutines.

Similar to kernel level threads managed entirely by the OS, goroutines are user-space threads managed entirely by the Go runtime and the runtime scheduler schedules them. This makes goroutines cheaper, more lightweight than kernel threads, and they run on a very small memory footprint (with initial stack size of **2kb**, whereas the default stack size of a thread is **8kb**).

The runnable goroutines (shown in the above figure) are picked from the queue to run over available OS threads, which, in turn, run on one or more available processors. The goroutines that are blocked are put into a _not runnable_ state queue. Once unblocked, the goroutine is put back on the _runnable_ queue and waits for its turn to run on the available OS thread.

### Fork-join Concurrency Model in Go
Go uses the _fork-join concurrent execution strategy_ to execute programs in parallel. This enables the Go program to branch its own execution path to be run with its main branch. This splitting branch can coincide at some later point and run as a single execution path. The fork part of the model states branching off of code at designated points and the join part states reuniting back to the caller after execution finishes. Let’s try to understand this with the help of an example. Here is a simple program showing how to perform fork-join concurrency in Go and Golang:
```go
package main
import (
	"fmt"
    	"time"
)
func f1() {
	fmt.Println("func 1")
}
func f2() {
	fmt.Println("func 2")
}
func main() {
	fmt.Println("Start...")
	go f1()
	go f2()
	fmt.Println("End")
	time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
}
```
This produces the follow output when run your integrated development environment (IDE):
```
Start...
End
func 2
func 1
```

### Race Condition
Race conditions are the outcomes of two different concurrent contexts reading and writing to the same shared data at the same time, resulting in an unexpected output.

In Golang two concurrent goroutines that access the same variable concurrently will produce a data race in the program.
