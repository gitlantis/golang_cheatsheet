### Elasticsearch
Elasticsearch is a search engine based on the Lucene library. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents. Elasticsearch is developed in Java and is dual-licensed under the source-available Server Side Public License and the Elastic license,[2] while other parts[3] fall under the proprietary (source-available) Elastic License. Official clients are available in Java,[4] .NET[5] (C#), PHP,[6] Python,[7] Ruby[8] and many other languages.[9] According to the DB-Engines ranking, Elasticsearch is the most popular enterprise search engine.[10]

### Sphinx
Sphinx can be used either as a stand-alone server or as a storage engine ("SphinxSE") for the MySQL family of databases. When run as a standalone server Sphinx operates similar to a DBMS and can communicate with MySQL, MariaDB and PostgreSQL through their native protocols or with any ODBC-compliant DBMS via ODBC. MariaDB, a fork of MySQL, is distributed with SphinxSE.[2]
