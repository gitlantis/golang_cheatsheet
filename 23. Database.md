### Relational/SQL
A **relational database** is a (most commonly digital) [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database "Database") based on the [relational model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model "Relational model") of data, as proposed by [E. F. Codd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._F._Codd "E. F. Codd") in 1970. A system used to maintain relational databases is a **relational database management system** (**RDBMS**). Many relational database systems are equipped with the option of using [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL "SQL") (Structured Query Language) for querying and updating the database.

### Indexes
A SQL index is used to retrieve data from a database very fast. Indexing a table or view is, without a doubt, one of the best ways to improve the performance of queries and applications.

A SQL index is a quick lookup table for finding records users need to search frequently. An index is small, fast, and optimized for quick lookups. It is very useful for connecting the relational tables and searching large tables.

SQL indexes are primarily a performance tool, so they really apply if a database gets large. SQL Server supports several types of indexes but one of the most common types is the clustered index. This type of index is automatically created with a primary key.

### Transactions
A SQL _transaction_ is a grouping of one or more SQL statements that interact with a database. A transaction in its entirety can _commit_ to a database as a single logical unit or _rollback_ (become undone) as a single logical unit. In SQL, transactions are essential for maintaining database integrity. They are used to preserve integrity when multiple related operations are executed concurrently, or when multiple users interact with a database concurrently.

### Sharding/Replication
Sharding is partitioning where the database is split across multiple smaller databases to improve performance and reading time. In replication, we basically copy the database across multiple databases to provide a quicker look and less response time. Content delivery networks are the best examples of this.
**Replication** (Copying data)— Keeping a copy of same data on multiple servers that are connected via a network.

**Partitioning** — Splitting up a large monolithic database into multiple smaller databases based on data cohesion. e.g. Horizontal (sharding) and Vertical (increase server size) partitioning.

**Sharding** (Horizontal Partitioning)— A type of horizontal partitioning that splits large databases into smaller components, which are faster and easier to manage. In other words — Splitting up a large table of data horizontally i.e. row-wise.
