### Redis
Redis is an in-memory data structure store, used as a distributed, in-memory key–value database, cache and message broker, with optional durability. Redis supports different kinds of abstract data structures, such as strings, lists, maps, sets, sorted sets, HyperLogLogs, bitmaps, streams, and spatial indices.

### Memcached
Memcached is a general-purpose distributed memory-caching system. It is often used to speed up dynamic database-driven websites by caching data and objects in RAM to reduce the number of times an external data source must be read. Memcached is free and open-source software, licensed under the Revised BSD license.

### Redis vs. Memcached
Redis uses a single core and shows better performance than Memcached in storing small datasets when measured in terms of cores.

**Memcached implements a multi-threaded architecture by utilizing multiple cores**. Therefore, for storing larger datasets, Memcached can perform better than Redis.

Another benefit of Memcached's multi-threaded architecture is its high scalability, achieved by utilizing multiple computational resources.

Redis can scale horizontally via clustering, which is comparatively more complex to set up and operate. Also, we can use [Jedis](https://www.baeldung.com/jedis-java-redis-client-library#Cluster) or [Lettuce](https://www.baeldung.com/java-redis-lettuce#clustering-1) to enable a Redis cluster using a Java application.
