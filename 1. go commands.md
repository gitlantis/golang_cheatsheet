***build*** - The go build command compiles the source code in the current directory and generates an executable file. 
***clean*** - The go clean command removes the output produced by the go build command, including the executable and any temporary files that were created during the build. 
***doc*** - The go doc command generates documentation from source code. 
***fmt*** - The go fmt command ensures consistent indentation and alignment in source code file. 
***get*** - The go get command downloads and installs external packages, as described in Chapter 12.
***install*** - The go install command downloads packages and is usually used to install tool packages. ***help*** - The go help command displays help information for other Go features. The command go help build, for example, displays information about the build argument. 
***mod*** - The go mod command is used to create and manage a Go module. 
***run*** - The go run command builds and executes the source code in a specified folder without creating an executable output. 
***test*** - The go test command executes unit tests. 
***version*** - The go version command writes out the Go version number. 
***vet*** - The go vet command detects common problems in Go code.

```
go run main.go
```

### Defining a module
more common approach is to create a Go module, which is the conventional first step when starting a new project. Creating a Go module allows a project to easily consume third-party packages and can simplify the build process

```
go mod init tools
```

This command adds a file named go.mod to the tools folder. The reason that most projects start with the go mod init command is that it simplifies the build process. Instead of specifying a particular code file, the project can be built and executed using a period, indicating the project in the current directory.

```
go run .
```
