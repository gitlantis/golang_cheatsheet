Reflection is the ability of a program to introspect and analyze its structure during **run-time**. In Go language, reflection is primarily carried out with **types**. The **reflect package** offers all the required APIs/Methods for this purpose. Reflection is often termed as a method of **metaprogramming.** To understand Reflection better let us get a primer on empty interfaces first:

> “An interface that specifies zero methods is known as the empty interface.”

The empty interface is extremely useful when we are declaring a function with unknown parameters and data types. Library methods such as Println, Printf take empty interfaces as arguments. The empty interface has certain hidden properties that give it functionality. The data is abstracted in the following way.

***TypeOf(val)*** - This function returns a value that implements the Type interface, which describes the type of the specified value. 
***ValueOf(val)*** - This function returns a Value struct, which allows the specified value to be inspected and manipulated

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"reflect"
	"strings"
)

func printDetails(values ...interface{}) {
	for _, elem := range values {
		fieldDetails := []string{}
		elemType := reflect.TypeOf(elem)
		elemValue := reflect.ValueOf(elem)
		if elemType.Kind() == reflect.Struct {
			for i := 0; i < elemType.NumField(); i++ {
				fieldName := elemType.Field(i).Name
				fieldVal := elemValue.Field(i)
				fieldDetails = append(fieldDetails,
					fmt.Sprintf("%v: %v", fieldName, fieldVal))
			}
			Printfln("%v: %v", elemType.Name(), strings.Join(fieldDetails, ", "))
		} else {
			Printfln("%v: %v", elemType.Name(), elemValue)
		}
	}
}

type Payment struct {
	Currency string
	Amount   float64
}

func main() {
	product := Product{
		Name: "Kayak", Category: "Watersports", Price: 279,
	}
	customer := Customer{Name: "Alice", City: "New York"}
	payment := Payment{Currency: "USD", Amount: 100.50}
	printDetails(product, customer, payment, 10, true)
}
```
***output:***
```go
Product: Name: Kayak, Category: Watersports, Price: 279 
Customer: Name: Alice, City: New York 
Payment: Currency: USD, Amount: 100.5 
int: 10 
bool: true
```
