### WaitGroups

### Using Mutual Exclusion
```go
package main

import (
	"sync"
	"time"
)

var waitGroup = sync.WaitGroup{}

func doSum(count int, val *int) {
	time.Sleep(time.Second)
	for i := 0; i < count; i++ {
		*val++
	}
	waitGroup.Done()
}
func main() {
	counter := 0
	numRoutines := 3
	waitGroup.Add(numRoutines)
	for i := 0; i < numRoutines; i++ {
		go doSum(5000, &counter)
	}
	waitGroup.Wait()
	Printfln("Total: %v", counter)
}
```
***output:***
```go
Total: 12129
```
You may see a different result, and running the project repeatedly can generate a different result each time. You may get the correct result—which is 15,000, since there are three goroutines each performing 5,000 operations—but that happens rarely on my machine. This behavior can differ between operating systems. In my simple testing, I consistently encountered problems on Windows while Linux worked more often.
The problem is that the increment operator isn’t atomic, which means that it requires several steps to complete: the counter variable is read, incremented, and written. This is a simplification, but the problem is that these steps are being performed in parallel by goroutines, and they start to overlap

One way to solve this problem is with mutual exclusion, which ensures that a goroutine has exclusive access to the data it requires and prevents other goroutines from accessing that data.
Mutual exclusion is like checking out a book from the library. Only one person can check out the book at any given time, and all the other people who would like that book have to wait until the first person has finished, at which point the book can be checked out by someone else.

***Lock()*** - This method locks the Mutex. If the Mutex is already locked, this method blocks until it is unlocked. 
***Unlock()*** - This method unlocks the Mutex

Using a Mutex
```go
package main

import (
	"sync"
	"time"
)

var waitGroup = sync.WaitGroup{}
var mutex = sync.Mutex{}

func doSum(count int, val *int) {
	time.Sleep(time.Second)
	for i := 0; i < count; i++ {
		mutex.Lock()
		*val++
		mutex.Unlock()
	}
	waitGroup.Done()
}
func main() {
	counter := 0
	numRoutines := 3
	waitGroup.Add(numRoutines)
	for i := 0; i < numRoutines; i++ {
		go doSum(5000, &counter)
	}
	waitGroup.Wait()
	Printfln("Total: %v", counter)
}
```
A Mutex is unlocked when it is created, which means that the first goroutine that calls the Lock method won’t block and will be able to increment the counter variable. The goroutine is said to have acquired the lock. Any other goroutine that calls the Lock method will block until the Unlock method is called, known as releasing the lock, at which point another goroutine will be able to acquire the lock and proceed with its access to the counter variable. The result is that only one goroutine at a time can increment the variable

Performing Fewer Mutex Operations
```go
...
func doSum(count int, val *int) {
	time.Sleep(time.Second)
	mutex.Lock()
	for i := 0; i < count; i++ {
		 *val++
	}
	mutex.Unlock()
	waitGroup.Done()
}
...
```

### Using a Read-Write Mutex
A Mutex treats all goroutines as being equal and allows only one goroutine to acquire the lock. The RWMutex struct is more flexible and supports two categories of goroutine: readers and writers. Any number of readers can acquire the lock simultaneously, or a single writer can acquire the lock. The idea is that readers only care about conflicts with writers and can execute concurrently with other readers without difficulty.

***RLock()*** - This method attempts to acquire the read lock and will block until it is acquired. ***RUnlock()*** - This method releases the read lock. Lock() This method attempts to acquire the write lock and will block until it is acquired. 
***Unlock()*** - This method releases the write lock. 
***RLocker()*** - This method returns a pointer to a Locker for acquiring and releasing the read lock, as described in the “Using Conditions to Coordinate Goroutines” section.

### Contexts
Go makes it easy to create server apps, which receive requests on behalf of clients and process them in their own goroutine. The context package provides the Context interface, which makes it easier to manage requests using the methods.

The Methods Defined by the Context Interface
***
***Value(key)*** - This method returns the value associated with the specified key. 
***Done()*** - This method returns a channel that can be used to receive a cancelation notification. 
***Deadline()*** - This method returns the time.Time that represents the deadline for the request and a bool value that will be false if no deadline has been specified. 
***Err()*** - This method returns an error that indicates why the Done channel received a signal. The context package defines two variables that can be used to compare the error: Canceled indicates that the request was canceled, and DeadlineExeeded indicates that the deadline passed.

The context Package Functions for Creating Context Values
***
***Background()*** - This method returns the default Context, from which other contexts are derived. 
***WithCancel(ctx)*** - This method returns a context and a cancelation function, as described in the “Canceling a Request” section. 
***WithDeadline(ctx, time)*** - This method returns a context with a deadline, which is expressed using a time. Time value, as described in the “Setting a Deadline” section. 
***WithTimeout(ctx, duration)*** - This method returns a context with a deadline, which is expressed using a time. Duration value, as described in the “Setting a Deadline” section. 
***WithValue(ctx, key, val)*** - This method returns a context containing the specified key-value pair, as described in the “Providing Request Data” section.
